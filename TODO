* Change bulk operations to use ajax
* Import/update tags when importing commits (currently hits repo every time)
* Option to apply multi-operation to all matching commits not just current page (a la gmail)
* Preview screen before final notes output that allows editing / reordering of notes and displays them split by category
* Formatting for commit message? Turn [YOCTO #xxxx] into a link?
* Collapse "xxx rev:" and signed-off-by lines by default to reduce clutter
* If commit goes missing (e.g. rebase) it'll still show up in the release notes and no way to drop ?
* Layout of notes editing
* Advanced keyword searching
 * Exclusion
 * Search by file path
* Allow showing all results in one page?
* Case-insensitive search?
* Full-text indexing for speed
* Indicate if commit changes only lines that were introduced in a commit within the release? (i.e. almost definitely a regression fix)
* Allow defining a category on the fly within a commit?
* Allow stats analysis by month/other time period?
* Provide the ability to collapse multiple entries into one
* Default set of categories?
* Strip note texts


Bugs:
* Removing a hidden category is broken (probably on the js end)
* Return a redirect instead of page content when posting (for multi-action form submit)
* Error if you have an invalid page in URL
* Wrongly formatted URL prefix causes error on page load
* If no results in specified page > last page, redirect to last page
* If revert is imported after commit that it reverted we'll miss it
* If revert uses OE-Core hash we'll miss it
* Sort commit category entries in expander
* Division by zero on stats page if a release has no commits
